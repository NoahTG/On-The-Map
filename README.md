# On-The-Map
Udacity iOS Nanodegree

â€œOn The Map (OTM)" is an iOS mobile app that shows information posted by other students on a map. The map contains pins that show the location where other students have been reported to be studying. By tapping on a pin users can see an URL posted by the student belonging to that pin. The user is able to add their own data by posting a string that can be geocoded to a location and a URL.
